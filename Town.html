        According to historical documents, in 1580 the lands located along the
        Murafi, Busha, Rusava, Yalanka, and Markivka rivers fell into the
        possession of the Polish magnate Jan Zamoyski (1541-1605). Crown
        Chancellor, who in the following years began to strengthen the region,
        build fortresses and castles in Shargorod, Yampol, Stina (Yangorod),
        Komargorod. Jan Zamoysky's possessions included the Dragushov lands and
        the Dragushov hillfort. In the first years of the 17th century, Jan
        Zamoyski gave his son Tomasz a manor and land along the Rusava River and
        its tributaries. In 1616, Tomasz Zamoyskyi began to complete the
        construction of a castle on the wasteland of the village of Prokopintsi,
        opposite Lake Biele. Tomashpil was first mentioned in 1616. The Polish
        scientist O. V. Yablonovsky in his works "Historical Sources" writes
        that the Poles, after the union of 1569, renamed many so-called
        "Wastelands", or settlements in the Braslav region. It is written about
        Tomashpil that it used to be called Dragushov.
